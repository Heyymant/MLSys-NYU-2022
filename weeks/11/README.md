# Week 10

## Serving predictions

First, make sure to run the usual `training_flow.py` to produce the model artifacts (the script and the datasets are repeated in this week folder for convenience, but nothing has changed).

After installing the `requirements` in your virtual environment, you can spin up the API and interact with it using `flask run`, and then opening the browser at the url displayed in the terminal (usually `http://127.0.0.1:5000`).

The current endpoint is very barebone - check the slides for suggestions on how to best structure the response!
