# Week 9

## Structuring ML projects with Metaflow (continued)

We continue from where we left things in [Week 8](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/MLSys-NYU-2022/blob/main/weeks/8/README.md).

## Code

* Login into Comet and get your API KEY - write it down and don't share it: it is required to do your homework!
* `comet_playground.py` contains a simple end-to-end script to test that the Comet integration works as expected - `requirements.txt` contains the required dependencies. Check the code to know how to run it with the API KEY, e.g. `COMET_API_KEY=xxx MY_PROJECT_NAME=yyy python comet_playground.py`.

## Guest Talk

* [Hugo Bowne-Anderson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-bowne-anderson-045939a5/) - Head of Developer Relations at [Outerbounds](https://outerbounds.com/) and exceptional educator - will present the case for Metaflow in the industry, and showcase a purely web-based interface for developing ML pipelines.
