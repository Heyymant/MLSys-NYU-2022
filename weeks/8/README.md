# Week 8

## Structuring ML projects with Metaflow

* `src` is the folder containing the scripts we will described during the class;
* `requirements.txt` holds the Python dependencies required for running the scripts.

## Data

- `regression_dataset.txt` is a fake regression dataset to run the code - you can generate another dataset with different parameters or cardinality using the `create_fake_dataset.py` script. 

## External links and misc. stuff
