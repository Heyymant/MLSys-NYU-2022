# Week 8

## Structuring ML projects with Metaflow

* `src` is the folder containing the scripts we will described during the class;
* `notebooks` is the folder containing a notebook showcasing Metaflow API;
* `requirements.txt` holds the Python dependencies required for running the scripts.

Note: to run `small_flow.py`, use the Metaflow syntax `python small_flow.py run`.

## Data

- `regression_dataset.txt` is a fake regression dataset to run the code - you can generate another dataset with different parameters or cardinality using the `create_fake_dataset.py` script.
