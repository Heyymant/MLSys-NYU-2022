# Week 10

## Building trust in your model

## Sharing your model as a prototype

The `app` folder contains a Streamlit app that uses Metaflow Client API to retrieve the artifacts from the latest run from `training_flow.py` (which is the same linear regression flow from week 8, here as a simple example).

Make sure all dependecies are installed and that you run the flow in `training_flow.py` at least once successfully. Then:

* cd into `app`
* run `streamlit run app.py`

A browser window will open with the app!
